      <summary>A swap chain is a series of buffers that can be drawn to and presented to the screen.</summary>
      <remarks>Like a bitmap, a swap chain has a fixed with and height, and stores 2D 
      information. Underlying this, however, it may consist of multiple 
      buffers. For more information about native swap chains, see the 
      documentation on

        The swap chain's pixel format will default to DirectXPixelFormat::B8G8R8A8UIntNormalized,
        its buffer count will be 2, and its alpha mode will be CanvasAlphaMode::Premultiplied.
        Size is in device independent pixels (dips), and DPI is taken from the specified resource creator interface.

      <summary>Presents a rendered image, using the specified sync interval.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>Sync interval determines how the swapchain synchronizes with display vertical blank:</p>
        <p>0 - cancel any remaining time on the previously presented frame, and discard this frame if a newer frame is queued.</p>
        <p>1,2,3,4 - synchronize presentation for at least n vertical blanks.</p>
        <p>Values greater than 4 are not supported.</p>
        <p>For instance on a 60hz display, specifying a sync interval of 2 limits the swapchain to present at a maximum of 30 fps.</p>

        <p>This matrix scales and/or translates how the swapchain appears on the display.
           It defaults to identity, which maps swapchain pixels 1:1 with the output.</p>
        <p>Swapchain scaling may be used to render at a lower resolution than the physical screen.</p>
        <p>Only scale and translation components are allowed in the matrix (no rotation, skew, etc.)</p>

    <member name="P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasSwapChain.SourceSize">
      <summary>Specifies that only a subregion of the swapchain should be displayed.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          This property can be used to optimize rendering by only drawing to part of the swapchain, then
          scaling up that region to fill the same area that would normally have been covered by the entire
          swapchain. Because fewer pixels need to be written, this can reduce GPU rendering cost. The
          source size can be efficiently changed before every present, dynamically adjusting resolution
          to match the current rendering workload.
        </p>
        <p>
          The source size must be less than or equal to the size of the swapchain. When set to a smaller
          value, only the top left subregion of the swapchain will be displayed. Setting this property
          is functionally equivalent to using ResizeBuffers followed by TransformMatrix with a scale of
          originalSize / newSize, but changing the SourceSize is much more efficient than ResizeBuffers
          when you want to adjust resolution on the fly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The source size property only affects how the swapchain is displayed. You must separately use
          other drawing APIs to restrict your rendering to the specified top left region of the swapchain.
        </p>
        <p>The size is specified in device independent pixels (dips).</p>
