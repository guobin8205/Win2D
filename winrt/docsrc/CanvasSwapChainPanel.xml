        <summary>A swap chain panel is a XAML control which draws to a swap chain.</summary>
        <remarks>
        The size of the swap chain may be different from the control's layout size. In particular, it does not stretch to fill the control. For more information on swap chains, see <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasSwapChain"/>.
        </remarks>
        <example>
        <code>
            CanvasSwapChain swapChain = new CanvasSwapChain(new CanvasDevice(), 800, 600);

            canvasSwapChainPanel.SwapChain = swapChain;

            using(CanvasDrawingSession ds = swapChain.CreateDrawingSession(Colors.White))
            {
                ds.DrawCircle(400, 300, 100, Colors.Red, 20);
            }

            swapChain.Present();
